# Homebrew formula for cc-notes. Installs the prebuilt binary for the current
# platform from GitHub Releases — no Go toolchain needed. `brew install
# --HEAD` builds (pure Go) from source instead.
#
#   brew tap yasyf/cc-notes https://github.com/yasyf/cc-notes
#   brew install yasyf/cc-notes/cc-notes
#
# The FUSE-capable build ships everywhere one is published (macOS both arches,
# linux/amd64) and runs fine without FUSE present — only `cc-notes mount`
# needs fuse-t (macOS) or fuse3 (Linux) at runtime. If asset names or the
# fuse matrix change, scripts/install.sh and the bump-formula seds in
# .github/workflows/release.yml must change in lockstep.
#
# release.yml's bump-formula job rewrites the version line and the four
# sha256 lines on every stable tag — the trailing `# darwin-arm64` etc.
# markers anchor its seds; keep them.
